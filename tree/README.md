# Tree
A tree is a widely used hierarchical data structure that organizes elements in a hierarchical manner. It is composed of nodes where each node stores a value and can have zero or more child nodes.

The abstract tree data structure can be implemented based on an array, a graph or a collection of linked lists. The different implementations can be found in [`tree.py`](./tree.py).
